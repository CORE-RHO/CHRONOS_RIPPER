# CHRONOS_RIPPER
This script, CHRONOS_RIPPER, is a specialized video mutation engine. It shatters monolithic files into randomized, 60-second "shards" designed to bypass automated detection. Using FFmpeg, it applies high-speed transformations—horizontal flips, dynamic scaling, hue shifts, and audio masking—to ensure every output is a unique digital asset.
